We selected St. Croix State Park because we wanted to combine all the things
we love: family, friends, fun and the outdoors. The park has two group camp
facilities, both constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Works
Progress Administration. The larger of the two is closer to the park entrance
and will be where our wedding is located. The camp has a large number of rustic
cabins that are all reserved for our wedding party.

### Getting to the Park

The park is located about 30 minutes East of Hinkley, MN, off of Interstate 35,
approximately 2 hours north of Minneapolis and 2 hours south of Duluth.

Airfare from Philadelphia to Minneapolis is probably cheapest if you fly on
Frontier and depart from the Trenton-Mercer airport. For a more convenient
trip, we recommend flying direct from Philadelphia to Minneapolis. Flying into
Duluth will be more expensive and not be any more convenient.

### Getting to the Camp

The camp is about 5 miles from the park entrance. We'll update this with a map of the park when we get one.
