## When

The ceremony will be held on Saturday, August 22 in the afternoon.

However, we have reserved the camp for the entire weekend, so you are welcome to
arrive on Thursday night or Friday anytime and stay until Sunday morning (the
site must be cleaned by noon on Sunday).

We plan on providing family fun Friday and Saturday.

## What to Bring

We'll update this with more information, but you should expect to bring a
sleeping bag and pillow if you are planning on staying in one of the cabins. 
They have beds, but do not have linens. You can also bring a tent if you prefer
to rough it.

## Additional Accommodations

The park is located approximately 30 minutes from Hinkley, MN, where you should
be able to find hotel rooms at a variety of rates if you prefer not to stay with
us at the camp site.
